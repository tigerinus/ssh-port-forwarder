# ssh-port-forwarder
A ssh port forwarder based on https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2.

For some reason one remote Linux environment provided to me does not come with `ssh` command. I need to port forwarding functionality though. Thus here we have this little nodejs program to workaround the situation.
